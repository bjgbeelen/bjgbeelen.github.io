            I am a Dutch piano enthusiast and <i>Melody Hunter</i>. I have a full-time job working as a software and
            data
            engineer, while raising my three beautiful daughters in our young family. Any spare minute I can find
            though, I'm happy to spent behind the keys.<br /><br />
            Recently I recorded a few compositions at home. That really gave me a boost again to finish some unfinished
            pieces and explore new melodies. Stay tuned for more!<br /><br />
