                        Another recording of one of my favorite pieces. For a long time,
                        back
                        when I still lived in Amsterdam, this was the (only) piece I kept playing night after night (on
                        my digital piano). It
                        really became like
                        an <i>Evening Ritual</i> to me.
                        <br /><br />
                        This composition still amazes me, I'm really proud of it. I recall that the idea for this piece
                        was born at an acoustic upright piano from my brother in law, in their apartment in Amsterdam.
                        They were on holiday, and we were taking care of their cat and plants. There was an opportunity
                        to play at their unique and for me unfamiliar instrument. I find that often these are the
                        occasions that new ideas pop up.

                        I decided to ditch SoundCloud as the home for my recordings. Instead, I'm sticking with the
                        YouTube channel, to be able to include visuals too. I therefore rerecorded the pieces from early
                        June.
                        <br /><br />
                        This one was initially known as <i>Paardenbloempluisjes / Dandelion Fluff</i>, but I think the
                        heavy ending doesn't really match with this title. So instead, I went for a title closer to what
                        this piece means to me. I've played this piece at my grandfather's funeral, as well as at the
                        funeral of my wife's grandfather. To me this has become something like a 'positive' elegy. It's
                        a <i>Vaarwel
                            / Farewell</i>.

                        Since I revealed the first three demo tracks back in June, I became really enthusiastic to
                        finish
                        some pieces that had been lying around for a while. I had never find an ending for them, or
                        perhaps said better, I had never took the time to find an ending.
                        Creativity really got a boost from all the positive reactions and I managed to
                        finish two pieces in the last couple of months.
                        Next to that I have a handful of ideas for new pieces, so all in all it has been quite a
                        productive period.
                        <br /><br />
                        I've set myself a goal to have material for a complete album by August 2021. According to
                        Spotify
                        that should
                        be at least 10 songs or a minimum of 30 minutes worth of music :-)<br /><br />
                        The latest composition that I have recorded at home is called <i>Panorama</i>. And this time you
                        can also watch how it came to exist!
